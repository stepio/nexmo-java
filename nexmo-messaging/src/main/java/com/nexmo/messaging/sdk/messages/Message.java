     * @param type the type of message will influence the makeup of the request we post to the Nexmo server, and also the action taken by the Nexmo server in response to this message
     * @param from the 'from' address that will be seen on the handset when this message arrives,
     *             typically either a valid short-code / long code that can be replied to, or a short text description of the application sending the message (Max 11 chars)

     *                          This api, and the Nexmo messaging service will send this data 'as-is' (in conjunction with the binary UDH) and will not make any corrections.
     *                          so you should ensure that it is a correctly constructed message
     * @param binaryMessageUdh Most binary content will require a UserDataHeader portion of the message containing commands to enable the handset to interpret the binary data
     *                         (for example, a binary ringtone, a wap-push, OverTheAir configuration, etc).

     *                         UserDataHeader field that describes the segmentation/re-assembly fields required to successfully concatenate multiple short messages.
     * @param clientReference This is a user definable reference that will be stored in the Nexmo messaging records. It will be available in detailed reporting / analytics
     *                        In order to help with reconciliation of messages
     * @param unicode This flag is set to true if the message needs to be submitted as a unicode message. This would be for scenario's where the message contains text that does not
     *                fit within the Latin GSM alphabet. Examples would be messages to be sent in non-western scripts, such as Arabic, Kanji, Chinese, etc.
     * @param statusReportRequired If set to true, then a delivery notification will be requested for this message delivery attempt.
     *                             Upon receiving notification of delivery or failure from the network, the Nexmo platform will submit a notification to the url configured in your
     *                             Nexmo REST account that represents the outcome of this message.
     * @param wapPushUrl This is the url that will be submitted to the handset and will appear as a browsable message in the Inbox.
     * @param wapPushTitle This is the title that will be associated with the url being submitted to the handset
     * @param wapPushValidity This is the length of time (in seconds) that the message will be available for once delivered to the handset.
     *                        Once this time has expired, the url will no longer be visible on the handset to be browsed (Subject to handset compatibility)
     * @param messageClass (Optional) The message class that is to be applied to this message.
     * @param protocolId The value of the GSM Protocol ID field to be submitted with this message. Ordinarily this should be left as the default value of 0
